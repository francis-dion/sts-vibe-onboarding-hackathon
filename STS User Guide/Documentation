Mastering STS's Information Structure


STS's Structure:

Teams: Top-level organization, controlling access to work
Folders: Exist within teams, containing related boards
Boards: Where actual work happens, found inside folders
Frames: Sections within boards, often used for workflow steps
Lists: White areas within frames, containing cards
Cards: Individual items or ideas within lists
This hierarchical structure allows for organized collaboration and controlled sharing of information across different levels of your organization.
You can utilize pre-made templates or create custom boards for specific projects or decision-making processes.

Terminology
Board

A board is your basic screen or online document in STS. It is a canvas on which you can produce knowledge work.

Strategic Thinking Systems
Strategic Thinking Systems
Frame

A frame is the top-level structural component of your boards.

List

A list is a container for text, ideas and concepts.
Some lists are controlled by AI colleagues, other are entirely the purview of you, the user.

Strategic Thinking Systems
Strategic Thinking Systems
Card

A card is a piece of text, an idea or a concept.
You can modify it and drag it around the STS interface.
In this example, each card represents an aspect of the company. Giving AI Companions context like this helps it understand who you are and how it can help.

Ask & Find

We've recently introduced a powerful new tool that has two key features: Ask & Find
1. Ask: Ask AI questions directly without having to create a board first. Treat it like an AI chat, but with the ability to create a board with the results if you choose
2. Find: Search for content across all your Teams, Folders, and Boards. A great way to find previous work quickly & easily

Step-by-step instructions::
Ask: Ask AI questions directly without creating a board first
1. Click on the "Ask and Find" field in the top navigation bar.
2. Type your search query or question and press Enter
The AI will respond immediately in the same dialog
You can continue the conversation by typing follow-up questions
If needed, you can save this conversation to a new board by clicking the "Save to Board" option
Use it as a private space that doesn't impact shared boards
This allows you to quickly get AI assistance without the overhead of creating and naming a new board first, making it ideal for quick questions or exploratory thinking.

Save + Share Your Work

As you begin working and building your boards in STS, make sure to save your work frequently. This way, if you make some changes and you want to go back to an earlier version, you can revert to your backup.

Steps to Backup Your Work:

1. Click on the "Save Board" icon on the right of the menu bar. The board "json" file will automatically download to your computer.

2. Return to the Folder that houses the board you are working on

3. Click "Create new Board"

4. In the pop up window, click "From File"

5. Choose the json file that you just downloaded

6. Optional: rename the file if you would like.

7. Click "Create board"

You now have the saved board as a backup üòç

Strategic Thinking Systems
Strategic Thinking Systems
Strategic Thinking Systems
Sharing your Work

There are two ways you can share your work (your Boards)

1. Give your json file to someone else on the STS platform:
Once you have downloaded the json file following the steps above, you can simply share it with a team member or someone else on STS. They then can create a new board, following the steps 3-7 above. Now they have a duplicate or your board and use it independently.

2. Create a new board from your json file in a shared folder:
Following the steps for backing up your work above, you can open a folder you share with others and create your new board from the file. Now, all members of that folder will be able to see your board.

Create a Team & Add Members

Teams are groups of people who collaborate on boards together.
‚ûô Each team has its own members.
‚ûô STS users can create new teams or be added to existing ones.
‚ûô Users can belong to multiple teams simultaneously.
You have the control to share boards with only those you want with teams. For example, if you have boards that you want only for the operations team, you can create an "Operations team" board and only add operations team members. No one will have access outside of that team.
If you want to keep some boards private to you...
you can create boards within a team with only you as a member. This is a best practice when you don't need external input as you do your research or discovery work. When it is time to share that work, you can save the board and add it to the appropriate team or shared folder.

To Create a New Team

1. From the main page, click "Create new team"

2. Give the team a name

3. Add the email of the first team member (make sure to add emails that have registered accounts, or you will receive an error message)

4. Click "Add another member" for each additional member

5. Click "Create team"
You are now ready to add folders to the team. üòÉ

Strategic Thinking Systems
Strategic Thinking Systems
To Add Members to an Existing Team
1. Select a Team, either in the left side column or while in a folder, select the team under the folder name
2. Click the drop down menu to the right of the team name
3. Click "Team settings"
4. Add the team member email address they used to create an account
5. Click "Save changes"

Create a Folder


Folders are where you keep your boards.
‚ûô Each folder is a part of a team.
‚ûô You can create folders for companies, clients, departments, projects, and so on. Just think of them as a folder that keeps all your boards that share a common theme or category.
‚ûô Remember, you can control who has access to the folder by which team you add the folder to.
‚ûô Folders can house as many boards as you like

To create a new folder:

1. From the home page click on "Create new folder"

2. Give your folder a name so everyone that has access to it knows what boards it contains, e.g. "Marketing," "Clients," "Events," etc.

3. Add it to the team you want to give it access to

4. Add an optional brief description to further clarify its content to save people time

Moving Boards Between Folders

Moving a board between folders helps you keep your boards organized, e.g., by department or topic.
You also can manage access to your boards by placing them in folders shared with specific people. To make a board private, simply move it to a folder that only you can access.
So it's important to keep in mind, when you move a board, only people with access to the new folder will be able to see it.

1. In the folder view, click on the 3 dots to the right of the board name you want to move
2. Click "Move"
3. Choose the folder you want to move the folder to

Create a Folder within a Folder

As you create more boards, it will become important to keep your boards organized so you can find them easily the next time you need them. One way to do this is by nesting folders to reduce clutter in the main view. For example, in a company folder, you might have "Meetings" as a folder and "Sales Meetings" as a subfolder

To create a folder within a folder, simply click on the "Create new" button in the top right of your folder and select "Create Folder"

To Move a Folder to Another Folder
