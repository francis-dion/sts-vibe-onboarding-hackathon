On your right is your AI colleague. The “list title” confirms this, displaying the message: “AI colleague.”
Another way to identify your AI colleague is by the small box located near the top of the list, featuring blue letters and a blue outline. Currently, it displays “ChatGPT Standard.” We are using the latest version of ChatGPT 4o, but more options will be available in the future.
Click on the blue box, and a window will open featuring three sections:

	1.	Choose Your Content: Your content is sourced from “lists.” You can easily identify the list you’re selecting by its title. This list is titled "X".  See what happens if you change the name of the list.
	2.	Enhance Your AI Colleague’s Responses: Click on the drop-down arrow in the section titled "Give your AI Colleague a specific expertise or responsibility" (the print is tiny) to explore various options. Feel free to experiment with these choices!
	3.	"Select a List where to keep a copy of your answers (optional)": This feature allows you to save all of your AI output. It is particularly useful for blogs or lengthy content, as it organizes your input into large blocks of text, similar to this format.

The next card will explain how to utilize this feature effectively.
Next, we will add a new list to the right where you can store your content. We’ll create this list and configure your AI colleague to ensure your content is directed into it.

	1.	Select This List: Begin by clicking on the list that contains the card you are currently reading. If the "list", designated by the white area, has a blue outline, you’ve successfully selected it.
	2.	Access the Toolbar: Look at the toolbar just below the title of this board. Note that the options on the left side change based on your selection. To view the correct options, ensure you have selected either a List or a Frame. If you completed Step 1 correctly, you should see “Add Frame” on the far left and "Add List" as the next item on the toolbar.
	3.	Add a List: Click on “Add List.” Choose “right” as the position for your new list. Feel free to experiment and make changes later.
	4.	Title Your List: Now, give your new "list" a title. The title will allow your AI Colleague to see the list. You’re almost there!
	5.	Connect Your AI Colleague: Click on the AI (the blue box), and at the bottom of the pop-up window, look for “Select a list where you’d like to keep a copy of the answers.” From the drop-down menu, select the list you just created, using the title of the list you provided, and click “Done.” Type your prompt where it says “Ask a question here” and hit enter.
	6.	See What Happens: Look at the content in the new list you just created. Enjoy exploring the results!
To save your board, go to the top-right corner of the toolbar and click on “Save Board.” For detailed instructions on uploading your saved board, click the paperclip to the top right of this card.
